# CProgrammingProject
University project written in C to manipulate PGM images

### Key Functions
* Duplicate PGM images returning the exact same image content
* Accept ASCII and binary image input
* Convert images from ASCII to binary and vice versa
* Reduce images in size (WIP)

### Program Goals
* Building a modular program that can be easily extended to support more image functions
* Good code quality ensuring code is legible and there are no memory leaks (WIP)
* Using a Makefile, correctly to ensure all dependencies are accounted for
* Use of version control, for example branching to safely implement new experimental features
