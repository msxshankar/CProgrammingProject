List of modules to be implemented:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Modules

1. pgmCodes.h
 
Header file containing a list of macros for the preprocessor. 
These macros would include boundary values and error codes for pgm files. 
This improves modularity as it can be used by all files, reducing repetitive code.
 
 
2. pgmImage.c & pgmImage.h

Source and header file containing a struct and related functions which will hold the variables used for storing the image.
This allows a central location for all programs to look for, when accessing the image. 
 
3. pgmError.c and pgmError.h

Source and header file will contain all the possible errors that the program could produce.
This would include error messages and exit codes meaning that all programs can access a single file, reducing repetitive code.
 
 
4. pgmClean.c and pgmClean.h

Source and header file that contains functions to free memory when called.
This can be used as a cleanup program when an error occurs. 
 
 
5. pgmRead.c and pgmRead.h

Source and header file that can read in files and do error checking (using pgmError.h).
Should be able to read in both binary and ASCII files.
If this is successful, then the struct in pgmImage.h can be updated. 
 

6. pgmCheck.c and pgmCheck.h

Source and header file that checks that the outputted file has been written to correctly.
After the new file has been written to, a pgmCheck function can be called.
It can use pgmError.h and pgmClean.c/.h as part of this check function
 
 
7. pgmReduceUtility.c and pgmReduceUtility.h 
 
Source and header file that contains functions and structs to reduce files. 
 
 
8. pgmTileUtility.c and pgmTileUtility.h

Source and header file that contains functions and structs to tile and assemble files.


9. pgmArgument.c and pgmArgument.h

Source and header file that allows for argument checking.
This will return the correct value and output string.
